Sure, let's assume you have a SharePoint site hosted at "https://example.sharepoint.com" and you want to upload a file to a folder named "Documents" within a site named "TeamSite".

So, your values would be:

- `your-sharepoint-site-url`: "https://example.sharepoint.com"
- `your-site-name`: "TeamSite"
- `YourFolderName`: "Documents"

With these values, your SharePoint folder path would be "/sites/TeamSite/Shared Documents/Documents/". 

You would also need to replace `your-username` and `your-password` with the appropriate credentials that have permissions to upload files to the SharePoint site.
